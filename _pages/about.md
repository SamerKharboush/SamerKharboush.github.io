I am a highly motivated and skilled junior Data Scientist and Big Data Analyst with a strong background in
statistics and mathematics combined with heavy training on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning , neural network and Deep learning.
However, my data field was build on a strong background in SQL and Big data analysis certified from Google, IBM, Cisco and AWS.
Also have different skills in different visualizations programs Tableau, power BI, Excel and also
Matplotlib using python making use of data to drive decisions. Build predictive models to analyze massive volumes of data to make sense of it. Develop dashboards which are interactive and provide insight into what's happening within your system.

Also as a data scientist can add a great part of regression and ML modeling to the data to extract more
information beside normal analysis and interactive dashboards.

As a fresh graduate i had a python for data science internship in FBK laboratory, my graduation project
was building 3 different deep learning models to predict CAD disease patient using MRI images of
63,000 in a precision medicine setting. which was combined with GUI webapp of flask to show and
interact with the results also a denoising autoencoder to enhance the model's accuracy.

I've been working with a Chinese company named Luxury items based in Vietnamese, as a machine
learning specialist to develop it's back-end machine learning system and implement it in their website
from 2020 to 2022.

My previous work experience includes python programming, data analysis, and visualization.
also,
Experience using Pytorch , FastAi and TensorFlow for deep learning and computer vision.
Experience using Python for machine learning, data analysis, data visualization, and web development.
Experience using scikit-learn for machine learning model development.
I look forward to hearing from you soon..
